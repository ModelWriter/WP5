Objectives
---

The objective of Project Management is to perform overall project governance, and to establish and maintain a communication and controlling infrastructure, which can be `summarized` as:

* Monitoring, tracking & controlling costs, schedule, quality, scope, risks and realization of desired benefits.

This includes (among others) the following `main sub-objectives`:

* Managing the project according to approved plans.
* Ensuring that the required reporting is prepared and delivered in a timely manner.
* Implementing procedures for quality management.
* Implementing an administration and communication infrastructure for efficient and easy communication within the project and outside of the project (via the project website and the channels of dissemination and exploitation).
* Performing a procedure for regularly updating and revising the project plans due to changes and new knowledge.

All tasks will be accomplished by using state of the art management instruments and methods ~(namely PRINCE2)~ to facilitate unobstructed and successful project progress.

In order to further address the technical risks and build a complete product in a `stepped manner`, a number of Agile practices (from `Scrum`, the leading agile development framework) are also considered for use by a number of local teams, who will build their software components according to `an iterative and incremental  manner`, in short time-boxed periods of time (`Sprints of max 4 weeks`). For that, they will maintain a **local Product Backlog** (derived from **WP1’s more general Product Backlog**) and split the work into successive Sprint, each of them leading to an actual piece of software that can potentially be put in the hands of users of feedback and enhancement.
 
Expected Results
---

* Project running smoothly.

Approach for the Work Package
---

* The PRINCE2 Project Management method (www.prince-officialsite.com) will be applied, with a tailoring appropriate for this ITEA2 project. Accordingly, the management activities and associated management products (e.g. Risk Management Strategy) are directly derived from the PRINCE2’s recommended best practices. Especially, contents of management products are exposed in Appendix A of the official book (ISBN 978-0-11-331059-3).

Important note
---

Such PRINCE2 management products (identified as "product Ax" in the next pages) are not necessarily documents nor even deliverables.

* In accordance with the PRINCE2 method, the project is split into purely sequential Management Stages. At the end of each Management Stage, there is an evaluation of the performance of the previous Stage, and go-ahead is given (or not) by the Project Board for executing the detailed plans set up for the next Stage period. This project being a 3-year project, with imposed Annual Reviews, each Management Stage has been chosen to be 1-year long. Each of the 3 major releases of ModelWriter is aligned to these Management Stages.
* Apart from the non-technical Project Management tasks covered by this WP5, a number of technically-oriented management tasks can be found (for SA) in the other Work Packages, among others for reducing the Technical Risks.
* We adopt the following classical 2-level Project Management organization standard, which has proven to work in many European collaborative projects similar to ModelWriter.
    * The **Project Coordination Committee (PCC)** consists of one representative for each participating partner. Such PCC is chaired by the Project Leader (SA), who endorses the overall responsibility for the execution of the contract, for the effective global management of the project, for maintaining contact with the ITEA organization and for monitoring the interaction and the relative progress of the work amongst the partners.
    * The **Technical Coordination Committee (TCC)** made up of the Work Package leaders. The TCC carries the overall technical responsibility of the project. Each work package leader is responsible for the progress, results, achievements and problems (incl. Technical Risks) within his work package, and periodically reports to the TCC.
